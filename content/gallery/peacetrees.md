At a DemocracyLab event, I consulted with a volunteer for PeaceTrees, a non-profit
organization that helps communities in Vietnam. I got to learn about their mission
to remove activated ordinance left behind from the Vietnam War. The organization
had been designing an interactive map to embed on their website to raise awareness
for their projects in the region. From previous events, the project was partially
implemented. I gave their work a technical review and made recommendations on next
steps to carry the project forward.
