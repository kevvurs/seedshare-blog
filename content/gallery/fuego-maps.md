Space Apps is fast paced event for building applications to solve challenges for
NASA. Teams collaborate over a weekend to design, build, and test proof of concept
solutions. My team researched and developed a realtime and crowdsourced wildfire
safety Android app. We believe our app would help people report and avoid hotspots.
