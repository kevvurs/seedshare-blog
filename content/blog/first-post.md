Welcome to the __seedshare__ blog! I have started a blog and portfolio (of sorts)
website to share my experiences as a software developer. I have enjoyed
programming since I was just 12 years old, when I used to write awkward, chunky
games with Mark Overmars's [Game Maker][yoyogames] engine. It is not surprising
that I went on to become a professional software developer in college.

## the seedshare story
If you've previously visited this domain, you may recall the original
seedshare.io website, where I placed my portfolio for software work as I was
finishing up college. Actually, I originally purchased the domain after speaking
to a friend in 2017 about the broken process of finding jobs online. I felt that
I could develop a side-project to make the online job search a more _humane_
process. The plan was simple:

 1. establish some branding with a catchy name
 2. write an [article][seedshare-article] describing the project
 3. start a [crowd-funding campaign][kickstarter] to raise awareness
 4. deliver an MVP, running on Google Cloud Platform
 5. ???
 6. __PROFIT!!!__

OK, I was probably inexperienced and had a poor understanding of how a startup
is born. As expected, my product was a flop, and I admittedly didn't even get
far enough in the prototype to encounter the core complexities of a recruiting
webapp. I was about to start my fourth-year of college and although I was
already working as a developer, I had limited experience in UI development.
Anyway, check out some of the woefully under-developed screenshots I produced!

## pivoting to a portfolio
Almost as soon as the summer ended and I resumed academics, the idea of
seedshare as a jobs website cooled off. I had already purchased the domain name
from Google, and it was actually my friend who came up with the name, which I
think is pretty damn good. I was soliciting job offers as I entered my senior
year of college, so I quickly put together a basic website to showcase my
myself. I wrote the site with [Glimmer][glimmer], a quite small JS framework
that is related to [Ember][ember].

I had dark mode before Google made it cool (and overused it).

Light mode looks pretty snappy too.

I produced an effective and simple portfolio website on a cool stack using
Glimmer, which included TypeScript and Sass, BootStrap 4 (beta), and a lot of
Font Awesome icons. I tossed the build on Firebase Hosting and connected it to
the seedshare.io domain. In my senior year, I had a measure of success with this
site too, receiving frequent recruitment messages. However, I have stopped
updating the site in January 2018 and have decided to sunset the basic
portfolio.

## what's next
In 2019, I am re-developing the seedshare.io website to focus more on blogging.
The reason for a blog is not because I am a guru. In truth, I am learning so
many new things as I progress in my career that I began to feel a burning need
to share these moments online. This blog is not about being an expert or
explaining how to do things. This blog is where I got to process my exposure to
technology and design patterns, to tinkering with devices, to software products.
In some ways, I will integrate this site with content for my professional
portfolio as well.

### if you read this far down the page
Thank you for being here. I'm glad you're here. Looking forward to learning
things and writing about it in 2019.
