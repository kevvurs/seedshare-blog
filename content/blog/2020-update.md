# Happy New Year!
In 2020 I realized I wanted to write more blog content. I only wrote 3 posts in
all of 2019. When I started this blog, I thought the content would be educational,
semi-tutorials for software development and design. However, writing long blogs
was more draining than I expected. My free time comes in fleeting, unexpected
bursts. Experiential blogs require research, drafting, compiling snippets and images,
and review. This is not a bad thing, but take the GitHub Actions article for instance.
Nearly everything in that blog has been deprecated (thanks, GitHub) in less than a year.
The slow-burn of writing content with instructional value and observations is still
something I will pursue on seedshare, yet in 2020 I plan to release frequent, short-form
blogs based on creative thoughts and topics of discussion without any driving conclusion.

## articles in production
I have a few projects currently planned, and I will continue to develop them. Many
have already started, but these are the "slow-burn" experiential blog posts. It
will likely take time to gather the info, resources, fact-checking, and testing
to produce them fully. Giving myself space to write shorter content will reinforce
the cadence of contributions. If you checked the GitHub repository for this site,
you may already be familiar with my in-progress work. Regardless, here is a preview
of what is coming in 2020 on seedshare.

### how to survive microservices
Honestly, this piece was only delayed because I'm still searching for answers. Expect
a deep look at what it has been like to craft many services from 1 original monolith
in my team. We also had to contend with a complicated, hybrid cloud deployment, a
distributed & global team, and immense holiday performance pressure. Spoiler, we survived.
But why?

### the one about IoT
I had a side-project involving [Raspberry Pi 3's][rpi3], [k3s][k3s] (a lightweight kubernetes distro),
and [Eclipse Che][che] or [Theia][theia]. Basically an embedded micro-cloud running a distributed IDE.
This would make for a super useful programming environment that costs less than an
actual cloud-based IDE subscription. This project is on ice right now because I needed
to unplug RPi3's and free up outlets for Christmas lights. Rebooting soon.

### 3D bin packing
I have done work on bin-packing in previous work projects. I wrote approximation
algorithms to tackle the NP-hard problem for cost optimization in back-of-store
operations in Sears to reduce the cost of shipping e-commerce orders.
I no longer work for Sears, yet I want to revisit this problem in the future. My
goal is to develop an open-source solver, unrelated to any previous work. This
project will also have a kick-ass UI with 3D visualizations.

## looking forward
I will continue progress on these and more projects, and compile blog posts to cover
each experience. In addition, expect short posts which I plan to release.

- book recommendations
- startup ideas
- finding technical interview questions
- GitHub Actions pt. 2
- my Google analytics
- podcasting notes

I am grateful for anyone reading this in 2020. We'll make it a year for the ages.
